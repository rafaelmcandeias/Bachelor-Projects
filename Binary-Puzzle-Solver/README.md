# Project description
For this project, I was asked to devellop a program written in PROLOG to solve binary puzzles. A binary puzzle is a matrix n x n, where n is even and greater or equal to 4. Each position in th puzzle can have the value 1, 0 or no value at all. The puzzle is solved when all positions have values. However, the solution has to follow three rules:
#### 1 - It can not have 3 cells together with the same values. Line or column
#### 2 - All lines and columns must have the same number of 0's and 1's.
#### 3 - All lines are unique. All columns are unique.
