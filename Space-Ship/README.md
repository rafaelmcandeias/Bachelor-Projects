# Space Ship
For this project, we were asked to devellop a game in assembly. The game consisted of piloting a space ship without colliding with bad asteroids. It could collide with good asteroids, drawn as an X. The player could steer the space ship and shoot missiles via the control panel. Additionaly, there is a scoring system that would add points to the player for each bad asteroid destroid and good asteroid collected. The game would go on indefinetly until the space ship collides with a bad asteroid.
