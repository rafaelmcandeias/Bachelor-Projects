# Hello Quantum
### Introduction
In the Hello Quantum project, I was introduced to how a quantum computer works. In short, instead of bits, it uses qubits. Qubits consist in two cells that can have 3 different states, on, off and invalid. These states are represented by the following values, 1, 0 and -1, respectively.
### Part1
In this part, my goal was to write de main functions applied to the board game. More information here: [paper](/Hello-Quantum/part1/paper.pdf)
### Part2
In this final part, I had to implement the game Hello Quantum using functions previously develloped in part1. More information here: [paper](/Hello-Quantum/part2/paper.pdf)
